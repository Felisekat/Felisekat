### Hi, I'm Felisekat 👋

I'm a computer science student and aspiring game developer who found her way into tech a little later in life, but with a lot of heart. I've always loved puzzles and problem-solving, and once I discovered programming, it felt like a natural extension of that passion.

I started seriously learning to code during the pandemic. Since then, I've been exploring everything from Python, C #, Lua, Java, and C++ to game development in Unity, Love2D, and Ren'Py. Debugging can be frustrating, but I see it as part of the puzzle; each bug is just another step toward making something work.

So far, I've completed a game jam, participated in the first Hunter College hackathon (where I helped build an app), built several small games, and continue to learn and grow with every project. I'm especially interested in interactive storytelling, gameplay mechanics, and building experiences that make people feel something.

🎮 I'm especially passionate about immersive storytelling, gameplay mechanics, and building experiences that make people feel something.

💻 I’ve worked with Unity, shaders, particle effects, and player movement systems.

📚 I’m always learning, currently focused on discrete math and sharpening my problem-solving skills.

🚀 I’ve completed a game jam, built several small games, and I’m working toward creating my own game from scratch.
